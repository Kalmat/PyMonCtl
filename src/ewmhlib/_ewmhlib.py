        This property is set by a Pager, not by the Window Manager. When setting this property, the Pager must
        own a manager selection (as defined in the ICCCM 2.8). The manager selection is called _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT_Sn
        where n is the screen number. The purpose of this property is to allow the Window Manager to know the desktop
        layout displayed by the Pager.

        _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT describes the layout of virtual desktops relative to each other. More specifically,
        it describes the layout used by the owner of the manager selection. The Window Manager may use this layout
        information or may choose to ignore it. The property contains four values: the Pager orientation, the number
        of desktops in the X direction, the number in the Y direction, and the starting corner of the layout, i.e.
        the corner containing the first desktop.

        Note: In order to inter-operate with Pagers implementing an earlier draft of this document, Window Managers
        should accept a _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT property of length 3 and use _NET_WM_TOPLEFT as the starting corner in
        this case.

        The virtual desktops are arranged in a rectangle with rows rows and columns columns. If rows times columns
        does not match the total number of desktops as specified by _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS, the highest-numbered
        workspaces are assumed to be nonexistent. Either rows or columns (but not both) may be specified as 0 in
        which case its actual value will be derived from _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS.

        When the orientation is _NET_WM_ORIENTATION_HORZ the desktops are laid out in rows, with the first desktop
        in the specified starting corner. So a layout with four columns and three rows starting in the _NET_WM_TOPLEFT
        corner looks like this:

         +--+--+--+--+

        A Client whose window has not yet been mapped can request of the Window Manager an estimate of the

        the prospective frame extents and setting the window's _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS property accordingly.
        The Client MUST handle the resulting _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS PropertyNotify event. So that the Window Manager
        has a good basis for estimation, the Client MUST set any window properties it intends to set before

            This protocol allows the Window Manager to determine if the Client is still processing X events.
            This can be used by the Window Manager to determine if a window which fails to close after being
            sent WM_DELETE_WINDOW has stopped responding or has stalled for some other reason, such as waiting
            for user confirmation. A Client SHOULD indicate that it is willing to participate in this protocol
            by listing _NET_WM_PING in the WM_PROTOCOLS property of the client window.

            A participating Client receiving this message MUST send it back to the root window immediately,
            by setting window = root, and calling XSendEvent with the same event mask like all other root
            window messages in this specification use. The Client MUST NOT alter any field in the event
            other than the window. This includes all 5 longs in the data.l[5] array. The Window Manager
            can uniquely identify the ping by the timestamp and the data.l[2] field if necessary. Note
            that some older clients may not preserve data.l[2] through data.l[4].

            The Window Manager MAY kill the Client (using _NET_WM_PID) if it fails to respond to this protocol

            _NET_WM_SYNC_REQUEST_COUNTER. The initial value of this counter is not defined by this specification.

            A window manager uses this protocol by preceding a ConfigureNotify event sent to a client by a client

            After receiving one or more such message/ConfigureNotify pairs, and having handled all repainting
            associated with the ConfigureNotify events, the client MUST set the _NET_WM_SYNC_REQUEST_COUNTER to
            the 64-bit number indicated by the data.l[2] and data.l[3] fields of the last client message received.

            By using either the Alarm or the Await mechanisms of the XSync extension, the window manager can
            know when the client has finished handling the ConfigureNotify events. The window manager SHOULD
            not resize the window faster than the client can keep up.

            The update request number in the client message is determined by the window manager subject to
            the restriction that it MUST NOT be 0. The number is generally intended to be incremented by one
            for each message sent. Since the initial value of the XSync counter is not defined by this specification,
            the window manager MAY set the value of the XSync counter at any time, and MUST do so when it first
            manages a new window.

        Rationale: This hint is intended to replace the MOTIF hints. One of the objections to the MOTIF hints is that
        they are a purely visual description of the window decoration. By describing the function of the window,
        the Window Manager can apply consistent decoration and behavior to windows of the same type. Possible examples

        icons with the same dimensions as the screen, allowing the desktop environment to have full control of the
        desktop, without the need for proxying root window clicks.

        _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK indicates a dock or panel feature. Typically a Window Manager would keep such windows

        set the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR hint indicating the main application window.

        _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_UTILITY indicates a small persistent utility window, such as a palette or toolbox.
        It is distinct from type TOOLBAR because it does not correspond to a toolbar torn off from the main
        application. It's distinct from type DIALOG because it isn't a transient dialog, the user will probably
        keep it open while they're working. Windows of this type may set the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR hint indicating
        the main application window.

        _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_SPLASH indicates that the window is a splash screen displayed as an application

        _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN should be set by the Window Manager to indicate that a window would not be visible
        on the screen if its desktop/viewport were active and its coordinates were within the screen bounds.
        The canonical example is that minimized windows should be in the _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN State. Pagers and
        similar applications should use _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN instead of WM_STATE to decide whether to display a
        window in miniature representations of the windows on a desktop.

        Implementation note: if an Application asks to toggle _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN the Window Manager should
        probably just ignore the request, since _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN is a function of some other aspect of the
        window such as minimization, rather than an independent State.

        _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN indicates that the window should fill the entire screen and have no window
        decorations. Additionally, the Window Manager is responsible for restoring the original geometry after
        a switch from fullscreen back to normal window. For example, a presentation program would use this hint.

        _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE indicates that the window should be on top of most windows (see the section called
        “Stacking order” for details).

        _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW indicates that the window should be below most windows (see the section called
        “Stacking order” for details).

        _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE and _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW are mainly meant for user preferences and should not be
        used by applications e.g. for drawing attention to their dialogs (the Urgency hint should be used in
        that case, see the section called “Urgency”).'

        _NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION indicates that some action in or with the window happened. For example,
        it may be set by the Window Manager if the window requested activation but the Window Manager refused it,
        or the application may set it if it finished some work. This state may be set by both the Client and the
        Window Manager. It should be unset by the Window Manager when it decides the window got the required
        attention (usually, that it got activated).

        not supported for this window. The Window Manager MUST keep this property updated to reflect the actions
        which are currently "active" or "sensitive" for a window. Taskbars, Pagers, and other tools use
        _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS to decide which actions should be made available to the user.

        unknown atoms, effectively removing them from the list. These extension atoms MUST NOT start with the
        prefix _NET.

        Note that the actions listed here are those that the Window Manager will honor for this window. The
        operations must still be requested through the normal mechanisms outlined in this specification. For example,
         _NET_WM_ACTION_CLOSE does not mean that clients can send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message to this window; it means
         that clients can use a _NET_CLOSE_WINDOW message to ask the Window Manager to do so.

        Window Managers SHOULD ignore the value of _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS when they initially manage a window.
        This value may be left over from a previous Window Manager with different policies.

        _NET_WM_ACTION_MOVE indicates that the window may be moved around the screen.

        _NET_WM_ACTION_RESIZE indicates that the window may be resized. (Implementation note: Window Managers can
        identify a non-resizable window because its minimum and maximum size in WM_NORMAL_HINTS will be the same.)

        _NET_WM_ACTION_MINIMIZE indicates that the window may be iconified.

        _NET_WM_ACTION_SHADE indicates that the window may be shaded.

        _NET_WM_ACTION_STICK indicates that the window may have its sticky state toggled (as for _NET_WM_STATE_STICKY).
         Note that this state has to do with viewports, not desktops.

        _NET_WM_ACTION_MAXIMIZE_HORZ indicates that the window may be maximized horizontally.

        _NET_WM_ACTION_MAXIMIZE_VERT indicates that the window may be maximized vertically.

        The property contains 4 cardinals specifying the width of the reserved area at each border of the screen,
        and an additional 8 cardinals specifying the beginning and end corresponding to each of the four struts.
        The order of the values is left, right, top, bottom, left_start_y, left_end_y, right_start_y, right_end_y,
        top_start_x, top_end_x, bottom_start_x, bottom_end_x. All coordinates are root window coordinates.
        The client MAY change this property at any time, therefore the Window Manager MUST watch for property
        notify events if the Window Manager uses this property to assign special semantics to the window.

        If both this property and the _NET_WM_STRUT property are set, the Window Manager MUST ignore the _NET_WM_STRUT
        property values and use instead the values for _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL. This will ensure that Clients can safely
        set both properties without giving up the improved semantics of the new property.

        The purpose of struts is to reserve space at the borders of the desktop. This is very useful for a docking area,
        a taskbar or a panel, for instance. The Window Manager should take this reserved area into account when
        constraining window positions - maximized windows, for example, should not cover that area.

        The start and end values associated with each strut allow areas to be reserved which do not span the entire
        width or height of the screen. Struts MUST be specified in root window coordinates, that is, they are not
        relative to the edges of any view port or Xinerama monitor.

        For example, for a panel-style Client appearing at the bottom of the screen, 50 pixels tall, and occupying
        the space from 200-600 pixels from the left of the screen edge would set a bottom strut of 50, and set
        bottom_start_x to 200 and bottom_end_x to 600. Another example is a panel on a screen using the Xinerama
        extension. Assume that the set-up uses two monitors, one running at 1280x1024 and the other to the right
        running at 1024x768, with the top edge of the two physical displays aligned. If the panel wants to fill the
        entire bottom edge of the smaller display with a panel 50 pixels tall, it should set a bottom strut of 306,
        with bottom_start_x of 1280, and bottom_end_x of 2303. Note that the strut is relative to the screen edge,
        and not the edge of the xinerama monitor.

        Rationale: A simple "do not cover" hint is not enough for dealing with e.g. auto-hide panels.

        Notes: An auto-hide panel SHOULD set the strut to be its minimum, hidden size. A "corner" panel that does not
        extend for the full length of a screen border SHOULD only set one strut.

        Clients should set this property on every new toplevel window, before mapping the window, to the
        timestamp of the user interaction that caused the window to appear. A client that only deals with
        core events, might, for example, use the timestamp of the last KeyPress or ButtonPress event.
        ButtonRelease and KeyRelease events should not generally be considered to be user interaction,
        because an application may receive KeyRelease events from global keybindings, and generally release
        events may have later timestamp than actions that were triggered by the matching press events.
        Clients can obtain the timestamp that caused its first window to appear from the DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID
        environment variable, if the app was launched with startup notification. If the client does not know
        the timestamp of the user interaction that caused the first window to appear (e.g. because it was not

        Xlib provides functions that you can use to set and read the WM_HINTS property for a given window.
        These functions use the flags and the XWMHints structure, as defined in Xlib.Xutil.*

        The XWMHints structure contains:

            flags: int
            input: int
            initial_state: int
            icon_pixmap: Xlib.xobject.drawable.Pixmap

            icon_mask: Xlib.xobject.drawable.Pixmap
            window_group: Xlib.xobject.drawable.Window

        To check if a hint is present or not, use bitwise operand OR ('|') between flags and following values in
        Xlib.Xutil.*

            InputHint	        (1L << 0)
            StateHint	        (1L << 1)
            IconPixmapHint	    (1L << 2)
            IconWindowHint	    (1L << 3)
            IconPositionHint	(1L << 4)

            WindowGroupHint	    (1L << 6)
            UrgencyHint	        (1L << 8)

        The input member is used to communicate to the window manager the input focus model used by the application.
        Applications that expect input but never explicitly set focus to any of their subwindows (that is, use the
        push model of focus management), such as X Version 10 style applications that use real-estate driven focus,
        should set this member to True. Similarly, applications that set input focus to their subwindows only when
        it is given to their top-level window by a window manager should also set this member to True. Applications
        that manage their own input focus by explicitly setting focus to one of their subwindows whenever they want
        keyboard input (that is, use the pull model of focus management) should set this member to False.
        Applications that never expect any keyboard input also should set this member to False.

        Pull model window managers should make it possible for push model applications to get input by setting
        input focus to the top-level windows of applications whose input member is True. Push model window managers
        should make sure that pull model applications do not break them by resetting input focus to PointerRoot
        when it is appropriate (for example, whenever an application whose input member is False sets input focus
        to one of its subwindows).

        The definitions for the initial_state flag are:

            Xlib.X.WithdrawnState	0
            Xlib.X.NormalState	    1	# most applications start this way
            Xlib.X.IconicState	    3	# application wants to start as an icon

        The icon_mask specifies which pixels of the icon_pixmap should be used as the icon. This allows for
        non-rectangular icons. Both icon_pixmap and icon_mask must be bitmaps. The icon_window lets an application
        provide a window for use as an icon for window managers that support such use. The window_group lets you
        specify that this window belongs to a group of other windows. For example, if a single application
        manipulates multiple top-level windows, this allows you to provide enough information that a window
        manager can iconify all the windows rather than just the one window.

        The UrgencyHint flag, if set in the flags field, indicates that the client deems the window contents
        to be urgent, requiring the timely response of the user. The window manager will make some effort to
        draw the user's attention to this window while this flag is set. The client must provide some means
        by which the user can cause the urgency flag to be cleared (either mitigating the condition that made
        the window urgent or merely shutting off the alarm) or the window to be withdrawn.

        Xlib provides functions that you can use to set or read the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property for a given window.
        The functions use the flags and the XSizeHints structure, as defined in the X11/Xutil.h header file.
        The size of the XSizeHints structure may grow in future releases, as new components are added to support
        new ICCCM features. Passing statically allocated instances of this structure into Xlib may result in memory
        corruption when running against a future release of the library. As such, it is recommended that only
        dynamically allocated instances of the structure be used.

        To allocate an XSizeHints structure, use XAllocSizeHints().

        The XSizeHints structure contains:

        # Size hints mask bits

            USPosition	(1L << 0)	# user specified x, y
            USSize		(1L << 1)	# user specified width, height
            PPosition	(1L << 2)	# program specified position
            PSize		(1L << 3)	# program specified size

            PBaseSize	(1L << 8)
            PWinGravity	(1L << 9)
            PAllHints	(PPosition|PSize|PMinSize|PMaxSize|PResizeInc|PAspect)

                long flags;		# marks which fields in this structure are defined

                int width, height;	# Obsolete
                int min_width, min_height;

        The x, y, width, and height members are now obsolete and are left solely for compatibility reasons.

        The min_width and min_height members specify the minimum window size that still allows the application to
        be useful.

        The max_width and max_height members specify the maximum window size. The width_inc and height_inc
        members define an arithmetic progression of sizes (minimum to maximum) into which the window prefers
        to be resized. The min_aspect and max_aspect members are expressed as ratios of x and y, and they
        allow an application to specify the range of aspect ratios it prefers. The base_width and base_height
        members define the desired size of the window. The window manager will interpret the position of the
        window and its border width to position the point of the outer rectangle of the overall window specified
        by the win_gravity member. The outer rectangle of the window includes any borders or decorations supplied
        by the window manager. In other words, if the window manager decides to place the window where the
        client asked, the position on the parent window's border named by the win_gravity will be placed where
        the client window would have been placed in the absence of a window manager.

            Activate a watchdog to be notified on given events (to provided callback function).

            It is possible to update target events, mask or callback function just invoking start() again and
            passing new arguments.

            Be aware it is important to define proper mask and event list accordingly.

            Clients select event reporting of most events relative to a window. To do this, pass an event mask to an
            Xlib event-handling function that takes an event_mask argument. The bits of the event mask are defined in
            X11/X.h. Each bit in the event mask maps to an event mask name, which describes the event or events you
            want the X server to return to a client application.

            Unless the client has specifically asked for them, most events are not reported to clients when they are
            generated. Unless the client suppresses them by setting graphics-exposures in the GC to False ,
            GraphicsExpose and NoExpose are reported by default as a result of XCopyPlane() and XCopyArea().
            SelectionClear, SelectionRequest, SelectionNotify, or ClientMessage cannot be masked. Selection related
            events are only sent to clients cooperating with selections (see section "Selections"). When the keyboard
            or pointer mapping is changed, MappingNotify is always sent to clients.

            The following table lists the events constants you can pass to the events argument (defined in Xlib.X.*):

                Keyboard events	                    KeyPress, KeyRelease
                Pointer events	                    ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, MotionNotify
                Window crossing events	            EnterNotify, LeaveNotify
                Input focus events	                FocusIn, FocusOut
                Keymap state notification event	    KeymapNotify
                Exposure events	                    Expose, GraphicsExpose, NoExpose
                Structure control events	        CirculateRequest, ConfigureRequest, MapRequest, ResizeRequest
                Window state notification events	CirculateNotify, ConfigureNotify, CreateNotify, DestroyNotify, GravityNotify, MapNotify, MappingNotify, ReparentNotify, UnmapNotify, VisibilityNotify
                Colormap state notification event	ColormapNotify
                Client communication events	        ClientMessage, PropertyNotify, SelectionClear, SelectionNotify, SelectionRequest

            circumstances in which you would want to specify the event mask (defined in Xlib.X.*):
